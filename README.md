# EK301-Mechanics

We are assigned to construct a planar trust that witholds the most weight using plastic straws and pins. Certain parameters, including straw lengths and the location of the load are pre-determined. With the knowledge that we attained from the course, we come up with the most economic (economic in that it uses the least amount of straws to achieve higest buckling load) truss design and predict the maximum load that it can withstand.

A MATLAB script utilizing linear algebra was written to calculate the predicted buckling load.
